This may come as news to some out there, but we are about to have a president elected by a minority. Donald Trump lost the popular vote. I know that some will say that doesn't matter, but it sure as hell does. This has happened twice now in recent years. Think about this. Once he serves his first term, and the year 2020 rolls around (try not to throw up), we will have had presidents elected by a minority for eight out of the last twenty years. That sure sounds like a lot more than just saying it has only happened twice, doesn't it?

That's 40% of two decades governed by presidents that the majority voted AGAINST.

We have fuckery afoot. We have fuckery afoot indeed.

The concept of the Electoral College gives states with lower populations a larger say that is inherently undemocratic. There is an argument that if the Electoral College goes away then candidates will only campaign and seek the attention of the large population centers and large parts of rural America will be overlooked. Well, isn't this already the case? I've never once, in my lifetime, seen a candidate out in my neck of the woods. Unless you live in a swing state, I doubt you have either.

It also goes against the concept of one person, one vote. Once a state his a majority, the rest of the votes in that state don't really matter. If a state goes to Trump or Clinton by one vote or a million, the result is the same. So in places like California, where hundreds of thousands voted more for Clinton than Trump, those votes don't matter. She got the electoral votes that California offered and no more. In many other states where Trump won by close margins, or even if Clinton won by a close margin, that 48% or 49% of people that voted the other way... they just don't matter.

The math proves this system to be undemocratic. We are supposed to have an equal say.

Doing a quick Google search right now, with 99% reporting in, Clinton won this election by over 600,000 votes. It was a close election, but she won. There is no getting around that. But she will not be the next president of the United States of America. And since this has happened once again, we need to ask ourselves, is this the system we want?

It will take a constitutional amendment to change how we elect presidents. I don't see that happening with a republican congress, president, and gubernatorial majority. That doesn't change the fact that it NEEDS to happen. We are working on 40% of two decades pissed away with presidents that the American people did not elect.

Whatever your politics, this shouldn't stand. Maybe this time it favors your view, but what about next time?
