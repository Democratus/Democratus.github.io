Unsurprisingly a lot of media folk are urging those of us that didn't vote for a fascist to give him a fair chance. Maybe it won't be apocalyptic. Maybe he won't lead us into trade wars and nuclear war.

Maybe. But maybe we don't owe him a fair chance. He just ran as part of a party that decided from day one to obstruct every effort that President Obama made while in office. If they could have I'm sure republicans would have stalled Sotomayor and Kagan too.

Trump has placed an alt right hatemonger in the West Wing. Chief Strategist, is it?

Maybe the guy who ran a campaign of bigotry, hate, and vulgarity doesn't deserve a fair chance. Maybe we should remember that he didn't even win over a majority of the public.

No. He doesn't get a fair chance from me. I still see a fascist who idolizes authoritarian leaders and disrespects the very pillars of our republic.

No.
